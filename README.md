## Hi there 👋 

I have been a professional programmer since 2011. It all started with the backend, but now I am much more. I can do frontend,
DevOps, be an architect, or do pep talks for the team if needed - I like seeing how the people around me grow. 

Connect with me with everything - you never know what will happen if you start talking with strangers.

You can also visit my business card page: [site.trurl.tech](https://site.trurl.tech), where you can find the services I offer:

* Software Audits
* Team building & mentoring
* IT consulting 
* CI/CD configuration
* Programming, of course - I transform complex business logic into beautiful code, I build APIs; and I bring clarity to the table

**If you are building some cool startup, do not hesitate to connect. I specialize in greenfield projects, and I would never reject an interesting offer.**
